APPM 4720-5720: High Performance Computing Spring 2018
=============================================================

This course is an introductory course in scientific computing and will cover a wide variety of topics, some of them are listed below. 

In designing the course I have been inspired by Randall J. LeVeque's course `AMath 483/583`__ so if you find that your are missing some information on these pages or if you want a slightly different description of some topic his `class notes`__ should be a good source of information.
