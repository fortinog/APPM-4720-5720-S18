 Homework Instructions
======================

The homework will consist of theoretical and computational assignments that you will hand in via version control. You will work as a group for the homework but it is expected that all of you can explain the material. For the write-ups of the assignments we will use a version control system. 

Typically you will hand in computer code and a written report. The grade will depend on the quality of both.
